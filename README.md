# Hello, Welcome to my Github :wave: 

## Background

I decided to career change into software development after 3 years working in first line technical support. I loved the problem solving aspect and wanted
to understand how technology worked under the hood. After teaching myself coding for 9 months, I decided to do a Full-Stack Development bootcamp at iO academy.

## Languages
